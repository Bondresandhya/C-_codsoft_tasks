C++ is Object Oriented Programming Language.C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language. This language allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming. It is an expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers. 
C++ supports encapsulation , inheritance , and polymorphism, making it a powerful language for object-oriented programming.
So I developed this portfolio using C++ programmming.
This is very useful for the  giving you basic knowledge about the c++ programming.

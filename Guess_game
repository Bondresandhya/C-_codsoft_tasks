Programme: Number Guessing Game

problem Statement:
Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

#include<iostream>
#include<cstdlib>
#include<ctime>

using namespace std;
int main()

{
    //seed the random number generator with the current time as returned by time()when it is passed NULL, in order to ensure a different random number seed each time the program is executed.
srand ((unsigned int)time (NULL));

//Generate a random number betwwen te 1-100, store it into the number variable.
int number =(rand()%100)+1;

//stores the guess the user enters
int guess=0;

do
{
    //Forword the user to enter the guess, store it into guess
    cout<<"Enter the Guess(1-100):";
    cin>>guess;
    
    //comparing the guess to the number
    if(guess>number)
    cout<<"Guess lower!"<<endl;
    else if (guess<number)
    cout<<"Guess higher!"<<endl;
    else
    cout<<"You won!"<<endl;

//Keep the game going by having the user guess again so long as they did not guess correctly
while(guess!=number);
